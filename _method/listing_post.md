After submission, listing is processed by Arbitrum:

1. all incoming listings are added into processing queue
2. listing photos are downloaded and uploaded to Arbitrum storage
3. automatic-moderation step (algorithms)
4. manual-moderation step (humans)
5. processing moderation result (collecting client statistics, creating historical record)
6. sending response to client via callback


It is client's duty to setup and configure HTTP server that accepts and handles
the callback.
