After submission, listing is processed by Arbitrum:

1. all incoming listings are added into processing queue;
2. listing photos are downloaded and uploaded to Arbitrum storage;
3. automatic moderation step (algorithms);
4. manual moderation step (humans);
5. processing moderation result (collecting client statistics, creating historical record);
6. sending response to client via [callback](/#/callback/moderation_result).


It is client's responsibility to setup and configure their HTTP server that accepts and
handles the callback.
